# Pickelrye's Figura avatar collection
It's a collection of Avatars I made, ranging from the silly to the dead.

To download everything, just download the entire codebase, and put it in the comfy /figura/avatars/ folder that your instance made for you.

If you want something specific, then let me tell you what the three categories are like.

- Skin+ is what happens when we stopped paying for Minecoins. It's supposed to look more like the vanilla player model, but with accessories attached so it still has a place on the mod itself.
- Semi-Poly is sorta my middle ground, might just rename it to "Blocky" maybe. It's still Minecraft-like, but less so a Steve or Alex clone. A top-to-toe custom model with cubes.
- Full Poly's the true meshy hellscape. It barely counts as Minecraft. Still, it prioritizes you having control by having everything be at eye-level at some point. (or just be two blocks tall.)

If any of these tickle your fancy, Then take a look around- AAAAAND IT'S BARREN OF ANY CONTENT RIGHT NOW. More on the way!
