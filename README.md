This is a collection of Figura avatars I made, ranging from the silly to the dead.
(if unsure about what a "figura" is, I'd recommend searching up "Figura minecraft mod" and hope to god you'll know.)

To download *everything*, just download the entire codebase, and put it in the comfy `/figura/avatars/` folder that your instance made for you.

If you want something *specific*, then let me tell you what the three categories are like.

- Skin+ is what happens when we stopped paying for Minecoins. It's supposed to look more like the vanilla player model, but with accessories attached so it still has a place on the mod itself.
- Semi-Poly is sorta my middle ground, might just rename it to "Blocky" maybe. It's still Minecraft-like, but less so a Steve or Alex clone. A top-to-toe custom model with cubes.
- Full-Poly's the true meshy hellscape. It barely counts as Minecraft. Still, it prioritizes you having control by having everything be at eye-level at some point. (or just be two blocks tall.)

If for some reason you still insist on a specific avatar:
1. Download the folder that contains the avatar's *name*
2. Put the avatar's folder in `/figura/avatars/`
3. Launch your modded Minecraft instance (with figura lmao) and click every button like usual to "play the game".
4. Pause your game, and **select the light-blue triangle button.** Find and select the avatar in the list to the left.
5. Upload the avatar by clicking the upload button below the player preview. (optional, but let's others see it too)

yay i think you did it. if not, then i'll just let youtube babysit you.

> This collection is kinda-protected by the GPL v2 License, which should permit remixing or modifying for free and to whomever, but not and never for profit or any other legal junk. This does not need to be patented, it's just free virtual cosmetics for Cave Game. Please at least credit me (Pickelrye) and/or any of the original artists if you tend to use any of my avatars as some frankenstein base lmao. It's a butterfly effect for information like that.

> The libraries used in here have their own can of worms attached to them, so I always credit them to make sure I don't fall out of line with anyone. Please dont kill me, I ain't a master of OOP or a god of Lua at all.

> In short: Do what you want that doesn't require a price tag or a patent with this collection. You are free to ruin it artistically. Finally, **pls give credit** and you'll be better that sssniperwolf.

> I also yap a lot. I can't help it.
