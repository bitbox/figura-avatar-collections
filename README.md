# Pickelrye's Figura avatar collection
It's a collection of Avatars I made, ranging from the silly to the dead.

To download everything, just download the entire codebase, and put it in the comfy `/figura/avatars/` folder that your instance made for you.

If you want something specific, then let me tell you what the three categories are like.

- Skin+ is what happens when we stopped paying for Minecoins. It's supposed to look more like the vanilla player model, but with accessories attached so it still has a place on the mod itself.
- Semi-Poly is sorta my middle ground, might just rename it to "Blocky" maybe. It's still Minecraft-like, but less so a Steve or Alex clone. A top-to-toe custom model with cubes.
- Full-Poly's the true meshy hellscape. It barely counts as Minecraft. Still, it prioritizes you having control by having everything be at eye-level at some point. (or just be two blocks tall.)

If for some reason you still insist on a specific avatar:
1. Download the folder that contains the avatar's *name*
2. Put the avatar's folder in `/figura/avatars/`
3. Launch your modded Minecraft instance (with figura lmao) and click every button like usual to "play the game".
4. Pause your game, and **select the light-blue triangle button.** Find and select the avatar in the list to the left.
5. Upload the avatar by clicking the upload button below the player preview. (optional, but let's others see it too)

yay i think you did it. if not, then i'll just let youtube babysit you.
